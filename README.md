# saving_plan
This small app is design to help the user save money. The user should write the numbers 1 - 100 on envelopes. The app will generate virtual envelopes and will help the use pick one at random each week. The user should then place the equal number of $ as the envelope number in the envelope. Once all envelopes are full the user would have saved up $5050.
The app tracks empty and full envelopes and allows the users to track how much they have saved.
